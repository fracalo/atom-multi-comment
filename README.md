# multi-comment package

a block-comment module built with the focus to interact with the default line-comment-command:

specs:
 - when both a selection's start/end point aren't commented it comments selection with block-comment tokens.
 - when one or both a selection's start/end point are in a commented scope, these get uncommented.
